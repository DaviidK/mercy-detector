# Documentation Template

This document provides a guide to ensuring consistent documentation style for
code in the repository.

## Requirements

Documentation requirements are based upon the style guide provided by the
CSS 587

To earn full credit, students must write code that is easy to understand by:

- Describing the contents of each file at the beginning of the file.
- Describe the purpose of each class (or other code), the functionality, and any assumptions made.
- Give the author and a brief description of code use.

- Documenting the purpose, pre-conditions and post-conditions for each
function (including main).

- Make sure the input and output (parameters) are clear.
Documentation should be included at both declaration and definition.

- Documenting each logical code block within each function when performing non-obvious operations.
- Using indentation appropriately and consistently to delineate code blocks.
- Using meaningful function and variables names.
- Grouping similar or related functions together.
- Placing different classes in separate files and naming class files with the same name as the class (e.g., Student.h, Student.cpp or student.h, student.cpp).
- Using appropriate white space between functions and logical code blocks.
- Using white space within lines of code. Operators such as = and + should have a space on either side. In for statements use spaces between expressions.
- Writing lines of code with reasonable length (scrolling from side-to-side should not be necessary to view a line of code). Break long lines into shorter lines when possible.
