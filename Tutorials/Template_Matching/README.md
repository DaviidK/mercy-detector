# Template Matching

Template Matching is a methodology implemented in OpenCV that helps find a specified template image in a source image.

## template_matching.java

The current state of this program takes a source image of Mercy's wand and two template images to map the resulting "match" of where the template image might exist on the source image.
The program allows for six methods of matching, as listed below:
* TM_SQDIFF
* TM_SQDIFF_NORMED
* TM_CCORR
* TM_CCORR_NORMED
* TM_CCOEFF
* TM_CCOEFF_NORMED
